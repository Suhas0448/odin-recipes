# Odin Recipes Project

## Introduction

The **Odin Recipes** project is a basic static website designed to showcase different recipes. The website includes a home page with links to different recipe pages, where each page will feature the ingredients and instructions for making the respective dish. This project will help me practice using HTML and CSS to build a simple, structured web page, and I will also demonstrate the use of Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Basic HTML structure (headers, lists, links, and images)
- Styling web pages using CSS (e.g., using Flexbox or Grid for layout)
- Creating a responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Using Git for version control to manage and track changes to the project
- Uploading and maintaining a project repository on GitHub

## Reflection (To be filled at the end of the project)

In this section, I will reflect on what I have learned by completing this project.
